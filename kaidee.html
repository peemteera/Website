							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-8 col-12-small">
									<p>I joined Kaidee in May 2019 as a UX intern and helped the  customer design team develop and improve the new Android platform. This was a 4-month project where I learned the ropes of UX Design with the help of my mentors. </p>
									<p>Kaidee is Thailand’s biggest online marketplace and serves as a buy-and-sell platform for firsthand and secondhand items. </p>
									<p><b>The Problem </b> <br>
										We noticed that there was a drop off in users during the posting flow interaction. Users will enter the app with the intention to sell items but exits halfway without completing their post. Why are users dropping off before finishing their posting?
									</p>
									<p><b>Our Goal </b> <br>
										To identify usability issues during posting and determine key features that will facilitate this process.
									</p>

									<h1>Our Process</h1>
									<span>The user-centered design process that was used for this project:</span> <br>
									<center><span class="image fit"><img src="portfolio/kaidee/1.png" style="width: 70%; height: 70%;"></span></center>
									<br>
									<h1>Step 1: User Research</h1>

									<p><b> Research Methods</b> <br>
										We spent a week with our primary users to get a detailed view of their process through in-person interviews and online surveys. Some of the questions we asked were…</p>

									<ol style="margin-left: 5%;">
											
										<li>What are your frustrations with the current app version?</li>
										<li>At what stage do you exit the app?</li>
										<li>Can you walk us through your latest posting? </li>
										<li>Did you complete the process? Why or why not?</li>
									</ol>
									
									<p>For the purpose of our two research interests, we believed that a user survey will help us gather data on general reading habits and objectives while a user interview will give us a deeper understanding of user interaction and thinking process.</p>
								

									<p><b>Data Analysis</b> <br>
										From the responses, I clustered our data into different categories to identify eight significant pain points during the posting flow:

								<div class="col-12">
									<br>
									<h1>Step 2: Defining Users</h1>
									<p><b>Personas & Customer Journey Map</b> <br>
										Using the quantitative and qualitative data from user research, I defined some personas to better understand their frustrations and needs.</p>

									<p>In addition, I created their respective customer journey maps because we want to pinpoint exactly where users are dropping off. For most personas, we recognized that users are leaving the app right around the posting and waiting period. </p>

									<br>
									<p><b>Key Findings</b> <br>
									I analyzed my research data, personas, and journey maps, and learned the following:</p>

								<div class="col-12">
									<br>
									<h1>Step 3: Ideation</h1>
									<p> <b>User Flow</b> <br>
										To address the issues we found from user research, we created a new posting from scratch and brainstormed where we can make necessary modifications. </p>
									
									<p>We created a new flow where users can directly transition from one story to the next, either by categories or related topics.</p>

									<h1 style="margin-top: 7%;">Step 5: User Testing</h1>
									<p> <b>Prototype Evaluation</b> <br>
										We interviewed six primary users  from a diverse range of demographics (age, gender, occupation). I started preliminary questions regarding their buying-selling habits and expectations for our mobile app.  </p>
									<p>Then, I handed over our functional prototype and gave them tasks to walk through with the ‘think aloud’ method:</p>
									
									<ol style="margin-left: 5%;">
											
										<li>Can you fill in the item title without typing? </li>
										<li>Can you put in the highest price for this item based on other users on Kaidee?</li>
										<li>Can you find the appropriate category of this toy figurine?</li>
										<li>What do you think is the purpose of this page (preview page)?</li>
									</ol>
									
									<p> <b>Results</b> <br>
										Users were overall satisfied with the new Android posting flow as it addresses their earlier pain points regarding information insufficiency and learnability issues. Here are the results from our testing:</p>
									<center><span class="image fit"><img src="portfolio/kaidee/8.png" style="width: 70%; height: 70%;" ></span></center>

									<p>Overall, users were satisfied with the re-design and stated that they will most likely use Kaidee’s newer app in order to complete their future postings.</p>									</p>

							<h1>Reflection</h1>
							<p>I felt tremendously fortunate to be a part of the Kaidee UX team — especially since I came in with limited experience in user-experience design. And despite all the hardships and challenges, I am very proud with what the team has achieved. 							</p>
							<p>This project not only taught me the skills to become an innovative, keen-eyed designer, but to trust myself in taking the leap to challenge preconceptions and invent something new.</p>
							<p>It was hard work, but we solved it!</p>
